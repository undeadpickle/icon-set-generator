IMPORTANT: Plugin ID for Publishing
=====================================

Current manifest.json contains a PLACEHOLDER ID:
  "id": "icon-set-generator"

⚠️ This ID must be replaced with a Figma-generated ID before publishing!

How to get the real ID:
1. Open Figma Desktop App
2. Go to Plugins → Manage plugins
3. Click "Publish" on Icon Set Generator
4. You'll see error: "Invalid ID in manifest.json"
5. Click "Generate ID" button
6. Copy the generated ID (format: long number string)
7. Replace "icon-set-generator" with the real ID in manifest.json
8. Save the file
9. Continue with publishing

The ID will look something like:
  "id": "1234567890123456789"

⚠️ DO NOT publish without updating this ID!

See PUBLISHING.md for complete publishing instructions.
