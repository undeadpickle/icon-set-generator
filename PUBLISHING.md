## Required Assets

### Plugin Icon (128 √ó 128 pixels)
**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a modern, minimalist plugin icon for "Icon Set Generator" - a Figma tool that transforms single icons into component sets with multiple sizes.

Design requirements:
- 128x128 pixels, square format
- Transparent or subtle gradient background
- Visual concept: Show 3-4 squares/frames of increasing size arranged horizontally, with a simple icon shape inside each
- Color scheme: Vibrant blues and purples (Figma brand-friendly colors like #18A0FB)
- Style: Clean, geometric, flat design with subtle shadows or gradients
- Include visual elements suggesting: sizing, variants, or component sets
- Should be instantly recognizable at small sizes
- No text, just iconography

Think: Figma components + size scaling + productivity tool
```

**Alternative Simple Concept:**
A grid of 3 squares showing the same icon at sizes 16px, 24px, 48px with a subtle arrow or plus symbol. Use Figma's blue (#18A0FB) with white icons inside.

### Thumbnail/Cover Image (1920 √ó 1080 pixels)
- Screenshot of plugin UI showing the interface
- Include example output (component set with multiple sizes)
- Show before/after if possible
- High quality, professional appearance

### Additional Screenshots (Optional, up to 9)
- Bulk generation feature
- Custom naming workflow
- Size customization UI
- Final output examples
